  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19. 10. 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the application (‚Äúthe App‚Äù) handles user information.
    The App is designed for auto mechanics to manage customer, vehicle, and repair data locally on their own devices.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit</strong> any personal data to external servers.
    All information (such as customer details, vehicle data, and repair records) is saved
    <strong>only on the user‚Äôs device</strong> and remains under the user‚Äôs full control.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</strong> ‚Äî Used only to allow users to select and attach images
    (for example, customer photos or repair images). The App does not upload or share these images outside the device.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not share any data</strong> with third parties.
    No information leaves the device unless the user explicitly exports or shares it (e.g., as a PDF).
  </p>

  <h2>5. Internet and Connectivity</h2>
  <p>
    The App works <strong>entirely offline</strong> and does not require an internet connection.
    No data is sent to any external service or cloud storage.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Payments and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not contain ads</strong> and does <strong>not require payments or subscriptions.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Since no personal data is collected by the developer, there are no stored records that can be accessed,
    modified, or deleted by the developer. Users can delete all their local data directly within the App
    or by uninstalling it.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:<br>
